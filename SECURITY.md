- **API Keys**: Proper environment variable usage
- **Access Control**: Local-only data access

### Infrastructure

- **HTTPS**: Recommended for production deployments
- **Dependencies**: Regular security updates
- **Logging**: Minimal logging to protect privacy

## Best Practices for Users

### API Key Security

1. **Environment Variables**: Never hardcode API keys
2. **Access Control**: Limit API key permissions
3. **Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys
